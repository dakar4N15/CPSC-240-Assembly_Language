//performance of your device's CPU upon running the square root instruction in SSE and also the square root program in the   *
//standard C library.

//  Program name: Benchmark
//  Programming languages: Main in C++, manager in asm, getradicand in asm, get_clock_freq in asm
//  Date program began: 2023-April-10

//
//Purpose
//  This program will run a benchmark test on your device's CPU performance by running the square root instruction in SSE and 
//  also the square root program in the standard C library. The main objective is to find how much time is required for a single
//  sqrt instruction to execute. This program will first identify your CPU name, type, and max clock speed. Then, this program 
//  will prompt user for a float to be used for square root benchmarking, followed by the number of times the iteration should 
//  be performed. Next, this program will get the time on the clock in tics before the iteration starts, iterate the sqrt instruction 
//  for the user's specified amount of times, and get the time on the clock in tics again after the iteration process finished. 
//  The elapsed time in tics will be displayed to the user, along with the time for one square root computation in tics and nano seconds.
